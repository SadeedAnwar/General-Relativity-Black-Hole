# General-Relativity-Black-Hole
Simulating a black hole. This section shall henceforth serve as a documentation for the process until it's completion.
We start with the specification of a python file to calculate analytically the Einstein field equations corresponding to a particular metric. Consequently we get some restrictions upon the possible mass distributions that can generate such geometries.
